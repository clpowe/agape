## Ms. Damey – Bar Prep Instructor, Agape Christian Bar Prep

Ms. Damey is deeply committed to supporting individuals from diverse educational, socio-economic, and cultural backgrounds.

As the child of immigrant parents, she understands the unique challenges and opportunities many students face. This background fuels her passion for helping each Agape Christian Bar Prep student confidently pursue a career in law.

In addition to her work with Agape students, Ms. Damey is a full-time attorney practicing real property and real estate law.

### Teaching Background & Community Impact

Ms. Damey’s love for education began as a Teach for America (TFA) corps member in Atlanta, Georgia.

There, she taught second-grade students in an under-resourced public school while earning her Master of Arts in Teaching. She used differentiated instruction methods to meet each student’s unique needs, leading to strong academic gains.

Notably, she taught in the same school district she once attended, giving her a personal connection to the students and families she served. This experience shaped her understanding of educational inequality and inspired her to pursue law as a tool for advocacy.

### Legal Education & Experience

Ms. Damey earned her Juris Doctor from Howard University School of Law, where she served as captain of the International Moot Court Team.

As a student attorney in the Civil Rights Clinic, she and her team drafted amicus curiae briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court, engaging in high-level legal advocacy early in her career.

She credits her time as a teacher for strengthening her leadership and problem-solving skills, both in and out of the courtroom.

### Personal Interests

In her free time, Ms. Damey enjoys spending time with family and friends, binge-watching crime dramas, and traveling.
