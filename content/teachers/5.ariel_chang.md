## Ms. Chang â€“ Bar Prep Instructor, Agape Christian Bar Prep

Ms. Chang is passionate about helping students successfully pass the bar exam.

Her approach is rooted in personal experience. After failing the bar on her first attempt, she had to balance full-time work while preparing for her second try. This experience gives her a deep understanding of the stress and time constraints both first-time and repeat test-takers face.

Because of this, Ms. Chang is committed to meeting students where they are, offering personalized, efficient, and effective strategies tailored to their unique needs.

She also places strong emphasis on real-world application, helping students not only grasp legal concepts but believe that passing the bar is truly achievable.

### Legal Experience & Education

Ms. Chang is currently a federal property attorney based in Boston.

She earned her Juris Doctor from Northeastern University School of Law, where she served as:

An editor for the Northeastern University Law Review

A Research and Writing Teaching Assistant

These roles further sharpened her communication and analytical skills, which she now brings to her teaching.

### Personal Interests

Outside of work, Ms. Chang enjoys spending time with her husband and two cats, knitting, and listening to audiobooks.
