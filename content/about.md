The History of Agape Christian Bar Prep

#description
Agape Christian Bar Prep was founded in 2015 after our founder received a divine calling from God to “help His people”. Since then, God has used Agape Christian Bar Prep to build and restore the confidence, hope and vision of students whose dreams of becoming attorneys were once shattered by challenging law school experiences or multiple unsuccessful attempts at passing the bar exam. At Agape Christian Bar Prep, we do more than just provide bar exam preparation and tutoring services—we build success stories and transform lives. Our unique curriculum not only promotes academic growth, but also offers students a profound opportunity to deepen their relationship with Jesus and be reminded of His promises for their lives—health, peace, and victory.
