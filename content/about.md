## About Agape Christian

##  The History of Agape Christian Bar Prep 
Agape Christian Bar Prep was founded in 2015 after our founder received a divine calling from God to “help His people”. Since then, God has used Agape Christian Bar Prep to build and restore the confidence, hope and vision of students whose dreams of becoming attorneys were once shattered by challenging law school experiences or multiple unsuccessful attempts at passing the bar exam. At Agape Christian Bar Prep, we do more than just provide bar exam preparation and tutoring services—we build success stories and transform lives. Our unique curriculum not only promotes academic growth, but also offers students a profound opportunity to deepen their relationship with Jesus and be reminded of His promises for their lives—health, peace, and victory.

## The Agape Path to Esquire

### Step 3
Students enrolled in our tutoring programs are assigned tutors who will guide them through the bar exam preparation process, help deepen their understanding of the law, and assist in developing, strengthening, and refining the analytical and writing skills needed to pass the bar exam and excel as attorneys.
