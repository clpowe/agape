# Law School Preparation Services

## Law School Exam Skills Crash Course
This five-week course is designed to help students strengthen the foundational skills necessary to succeed on law school exams before starting the intensive reading and study period. By strengthening these skills in advance, we believe students will be more confident and better prepared as they enter final exams.  Our curriculum for the course includes:
- Week 1: How to actively learn from lectures and outlines
- Week 2: How to actively engage with practice questions, emphasizing the application of law to facts
- Week 3: How to approach and analyze essay exams, with a focus on issue spotting
- Week 4: Refining and strengthening analytical and critical thinking skills tested on law school exams
- Week 5: Writing concisely in the active voice, followed by a skills assessment to test students’ growth
The course consists of 90-minute classes held twice a week, with short homework assignments graded by the instructor between sessions. The course is offered in sections of 7 to 10 students to promote interaction and foster a supportive learning environment. The course is offered twice yearly- from mid-October to mid-November, and from mid-March to mid-April. To ensure students fully benefit from the course, students are required to sign a commitment agreement, affirming their commitment to attend all classes and complete all assignments.
