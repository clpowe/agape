# The Academy

At Agape Christian Bar Prep, we specialize in crafting personalized learning plans for each student, accommodating their unique lifestyles, and optimizing their learning experience and exam readiness. We consistently assess the progress of each student's learning journey, enabling us to identify and address any gaps or deficiencies in their understanding of the law.

The Agape Christian Bar Prep Academy, often referred to as "The Academy," is tailored to cater to working professionals, individuals who have been out of law school for over a year, and students in their final year of law school. Our program offers these students the necessary time to develop a comprehensive grasp of the law, all while enhancing and honing their analytical and writing skills, which are essential for bar exam success and realizing their aspirations of becoming attorneys.

Students enrolled in The Academy undertake bar exam preparation over the course of three calendar quarters.
- In the initial quarter, our focus centers on the MBE (Multistate Bar Examination) and the written segments of the exam.
- Moving into the second quarter, we transition from MBE to the state-specific portion of the bar exam, all while maintaining our commitment to enhancing writing skills.
- In the third and final quarter, students participate in our comprehensive Bar Prep 101 Plus program.

Our all-encompassing syllabus includes a personalized learning plan and comprises:  
- Weekly classes;
- Small-group and private tutoring sessions; and
- Writing clinics.

If you believe that our Bar Prep Academy can assist you in conquering the bar exam, we encourage you to contact us at 904-234-2853 to explore this unique opportunity further.
